Flashcards
==========

A free-time Python project with an end-product that I could actually use.

----------

Since alot of my GE's were memorization intensive, I decided to use flash cards to help memorize keyterms and the like. However, since my notes for these types of classes were often typed out, it thought it would be easier for me to somehow just have a simple program to display questions and answers from a text file that contains all of the questions and answers. Copying and pasting notes to form questions sounded easier than editing individual flash cards. Well, I didn't really look into any flashcard apps since I was determined to make something on my own that I could use anyways; I'm sure there are much better flashcard programs out there.

Anyways, the initial program that I made, however, required the question to be on a line with the answer following on a separate line-- they would then alternate with the script being able to use the specific formatting to display questions/answers on a console. The only features it had was to read the specially organized txt file and to display questions and answers either linearly or randomly (it would prompt for input for a pause after each question/answer was displayed).

The project here is a bit more organized and makes use of things I learned during from my last Python course (the previously mentioned program was made before I started taking Python classes as I learned the basics on my own). It also has a bit more features. My goal is to use the logic for a GUI version that will run on platforms besides Windows (probably Android). I'd also like to play around with Git and GitHub. I've had git installed for a while so I guess I'll try to use (intro software engineering course had an assignment that made us install it and practice the basics).

To reiterate:


Goals
=====

- 1 - (Done) Come up with relatively "clean" (compared to my very first program) logic for flashcards.
- 2 - (Done) Come up with a console interface that demonstrates the logic
- 3 - Come up with a GUI (eyeing "Kivy" for it's crossplatform capabilities and the fact that it uses Python)
- 4 - Come up with a GUI that can be used on Android
